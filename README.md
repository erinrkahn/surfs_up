# Surfs_Up Weather Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze temperature trends on Oahu to inform if the surf and ice cream business can be sustainable year round. Weather data stored in a SQLite database was used, specifically temperature and precipitation data from 9 stations across Oahu over the course of many years. 

## Results

### Summary of Findings

* A central tendency analysis on 1,700 daily temperature data points for June and 1,517 for December shows that there is a 4 degree difference in the average temperatures for June and December. June's mean temperature is 75˚F and December's is 71˚F.

## Summary

__Overall Temperature Analysis for June and December__

June's temperature ranges from 64˚F-85˚F throughout the year, a difference of 21˚F. December's temperature ranges from 56˚F-83˚F, a difference of 27˚F. With only a 4˚F difference between the months' average temperatures and a mean temperature between 71˚F-75˚F, there should be no concerns about opening the Surf and Ice Cream shop on Oahu.

### Additional Considerations

Additionally, we ran two more analyses to compare the weather between June and December. In June, precipitation data shows that the average rainfall is 0.14 with a maximum of 4.43. In December, the average rainfall is 0.22 with a maximum of 6.42. These precipitation levels should keep the surrounding area green, but are not indicative of a heavy rainy season during either month.

As an additional comparison, temperatures from March and September were also analyzed. The average temperature in March is 70˚F and in September it is 76˚F, both within the average temperature ranges of January and December, furthere supporting our recommendation of moving forward with the plans to open up on Oahu.
